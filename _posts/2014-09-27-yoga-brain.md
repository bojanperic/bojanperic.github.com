This week we’re going to talk about yoga boosting brain function, fraudulent research and the electronic world we live in. I also included the little video I made as a joke motivational for my basketball team mates after we lost our semifinal game last week (takes about 10 minutes to do with iMovie).

Let’s get started with a new study suggesting yoga boosts brain function in older adults (<http://tinyurl.com/k3qfz9v>).

"Hatha yoga requires focused effort in moving through the poses, controlling the body and breathing at a steady rate,"

“The yoga group was speedier and more accurate on tests of information recall, mental flexibility and task-switching than it had been before the intervention. The stretching-and-toning group saw no significant change in cognitive performance over time.”

I’m not sure how specific this benefit is to yoga. My guess is that the yoga group simply had a more complex skill set to develop (although I won’t disregard the possible positive effects of the breathing control). It was something that they hadn’t done before and I have no doubt that learning and developing new skills can boost brain function (<http://tinyurl.com/k8jjtah>).

This is partly why over the years I’ve shifted my exercise focus towards developing different skills over increasing how much I can deadlift. Not to say that there’s anything wrong with improving your deadlift ;)

Next is a discussion article regarding some fraudulent research (<http://tinyurl.com/nea7fun>). Turns out that not only do you need to be careful of how the media interprets the research data, how the researches interpret the data but you have to be careful that the researches aren’t just plain lying…

Basically the subjects weren’t eating a diet even close to the description the researches stated the were eating in their paper. Pretty ridiculous really. Worth a read for the laugh although it leaves me more than a little worried.

Next let us have a look at some more consequences of our ever more electronic world (<http://tinyurl.com/qjbs8ux>).

“CONCLUSIONS: A higher number of screens in a child’s bedroom was associated with higher adiposity, more total screen time and lower sleep efficiency.”

Pretty straight forward really, isn’t it? But don’t blame Steve Jobs. He may have know what he was doing but he probably thought that more people would treat the technology like he did with his children (<http://tinyurl.com/q8o943g>).

And speaking of pioneers how about a look at Google vs Hospitals. (<http://tinyurl.com/ozzqch7>)

“It is true that the healthcare sector is not as profitable as many of today's big technology companies, but we can no longer deny the fact that hospitals and clinics offer choices that are no better than fast food. The priorities need to shift. Hospitals should not just channel their finances toward expanding their workforce and constructing new buildings. They must invest in maintaining a healthy workforce.”

Until next week guys!
