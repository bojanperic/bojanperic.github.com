Today we’re going to reinforce that saturated fat is not going to kill you (even if you already have heart disease), we’re going to address the myth of what happens to the fat we want to lose and we’re going to take a little look into the concept of macronutrient partitioning (or, why protein and fat might be a better breakfast while carbs might make for a better dinner).

Let’s jump in. We’ve talked about some of the benefits of eating fat in the past but there are still many people out there afraid of it, especially the ‘EVIL’ saturated fat. Well, even if you already suffer from heart disease it seems as though that saturated fat is not going to kill you (<http://tinyurl.com/of2hxo4>).

“Conclusions: There was no association between dietary intake of saturated fatty acids and incident coronary events or mortality in patients with established coronary artery disease.”

A pretty straight forward conclusion in this one, right? It just didn’t make a difference how much saturated fat they ate. The saturated fat gluttons didn’t experience more heart attacks and they die any quicker.

As a little primer to “where does the fat we lose actually go” we’re going to have a look at this little study (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20628884>).

These guys took some obese individuals and put them on a carbohydrate and calorie restricted diet and then some of them also did some high intensity interval training (HIIT) 3 times per week. Not the greatest of study designs but it does reinforce two important points. The first is that to lose weight diet is probably the most important factor:

“Fourteen days of carbohydrate-reduced diet improved oral glucose insulin sensitivity and fat oxidation in obese subjects. The energy-balanced HIIT did not further enhance these parameters”

The second is that you should still definitely exercise when trying to lose weight in order to not lose muscle:

“HIIT did not further enhance these parameters, but increased aerobic capacity and preserved lean mass.”
Alright so where does most of that fat go when we lose it? Fat heaven? This a concept that is poorly understood not only by the general public but by people that should really know better too. This study looked at general practitioners, dieticians and personal trainers (<http://press.psprings.co.uk/bmj/december/fat.pdf>). None of the three groups answered the question very well.

The most common answer:

“Most people believed that fat is converted to energy or heat, which violates the law of conservation of mass. We suspect this misconception is caused by the “energy in/energy out” mantra and the focus on energy production in university biochemistry courses. Other misconceptions were that the metabolites of fat are excreted in the faeces or converted to muscle.”

The correct answer:

“Our calculations show that the lungs are the primary excretory organ for fat.”

Yup, that’s right. We breathe it out! By the way, dieticians, were the only group that considered this possibility when presented with the multiple choice question “When somebody loses weight, where does it go?” and it was a small percentage at that.

So out of 50 general practitioners, 50 dieticians and 50 personal trainers less than 10% go the answer right of which none were family doctors… Makes you think twice about asking your GP for dietary advice, doesn’t it?

This is starting to get a little long and so we’ll explore why fat breakfast and carb dinners might be a good idea next week.

Thoughts? Questions? Until next week!
